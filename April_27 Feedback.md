Group 4

This group introduce the GraphVAE which is a new kinds of enocder-coder that learn to generate graphs from embedding vectors.

To solve current methods' limitation like graphs have arbitrary connections making construction of a valid graph difficult, the GraphVae choose to make the decoder output a fully connected probabilistic graph.

The experiment anslysis part is really interesting that it provide so many graph examples that we could have a intuitive understanding of the GraphVAE

In this presentation analysis the model construction part, and experiment analysis









Group HydraNets

This presentation introduce the idea about HydraNets

The HydraNets are broad networks containing different components dedicated to computing features of visually similar classes, but they remain efficient by dynamically selecting a small number of components to evaluate any one input image.

In this presentation, they clearly analysis the advantage of Hydranet that it reduces the computational cost by specializing components of a network. 

Hail Hydra!
