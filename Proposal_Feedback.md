## Group 2 Reproducibility study on open set recognition

The group 2 decide to do a reproducibility study on open set problem. They first introduce the that the open set problem which not only require to do the traditional clustering, but also need to reject those parts which are not exist.

Their dataset is MNIST

And they plan to reproduce SVM based model, sparse representation-based, distance-based, margin distribution-based and so on

May need to try some others ways or use some other notion to represent and explain the "known known classes"

## Group 9

Our team

## Group 8 Adversarial Attack on Classifiers

Group 8 decide to implement the adversial attack on DNNs to get better understand on DNNs and thus help in making the DNNs more robust.

They prepare two kinds to attack that one is change the label of the image another is change the training sample itself to make classifier return different label.

Their presentation sounds pretty good.

## Group 11 Using Deep Q learning to play Mario

It's an application study that using deep Q-leaning technique to train an AI games which could play Mario.

They direct provide the equation in their slides which is helpful for other students to understand Q-learning. The idea of the alogrithm is to map reward/loss to environment interactive actions.



## Group 4 Graph Neural Networks

Group 4 mention that sheir shall implement the graph neural networks. And if time available, they would try to apply it on some specific proejcts.

In this presentations, they provide a full analysis about GNN which is of great academic.

## Group 6 Fake news detection 

Group 6 introduce the bert briefly and try to apply bert in their fake news detection

## Group 10 

this team would try to repreoduce deep Q-learning

## Group 1 NFL score prediction

Use ML algorithm to predict the NFL(the National Football League) scores.

Providing more equation could be better

## Group 7 Name entity recognition

This team first introduce the name entiry recognition which is used to classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text in pre-defined categories such as organizations, locations and so on.

Recreate the detector/classifier network using ML framework

They may meet the challenge that they may need to reject the sample which not belong to any cluster.

## Group 3 Music generation by Gan

This team will implement the midiNet which is based on GAN.

They choose to use cnn as generator and let discriminator learn the distribution of melodies.

They introduced 3 method including "melody geerator, no chord condition" , "melody generator with chord condition", and "melody generator with chord condition, creative mode".
