## Team 8 Adversarial Attack

Providing flow chart when introduce the styleGan and AC-GAn shall be better

In training process, a flow chart to show the training procedure is also needed.

Well data analysis including MNIST, Celeb_A, and FER13.

## Team 6 Fake news detection using RoBERTa

Related Work: Classifier, Neural Nets, Transformer were all used in this domain to detect fake news.

Need more specific information like how does classifier is used in fakes new detection.

Textual Preprocessing: well organized ! Clear told us how to eleminate unrelated text noise. Like the new's author names.

Training the Model: Flow chart is needed instead of text description on slides.

Results: Need to mention which dataset they used.

Result shown: Excellent! They provide a website which use the color to mention if the input news is real or fake. 

## Team 1 Predicting Future NFL preformance of college football players

Target: develop a neural network to correctly predict NFL performance.

This project is more like trying to build model for predicting player permormance.

We could find that they did spend valuable time on determine player score fucntion.

The introdution part takes too much time instead of explaing the model.

Need more detail about their model including flow chat, loss function, and pseudo code.



## Team 11 Using Deep Q learning to play Mario

A summary of their model/baseline need to be conclude at first. It is not until the Frame-preprocessing part that I know that their model is frame based. 

The sample run is really interesting!

## Team 2 Open set recognition

More slides is needed when telling any examples instead stay at introduction part.

## Team 7 Multi-Grained Named Entity Recognition

Takes too much time before introduce the Model Architecture.

Control Presentation Time.

## Team 10 DQN's and Dueling Networks

Brief introduction. Pretty detailed model.

Model description part need a flow chart to show the construction of the model.

Need mention what kinds of datasets were used. Need a table to show all experiment results.

Control Time. 

## Team 4 Graph Neural Networks: Introduction

Merge the pattern recognition and graph neural network. Member 1's Application 1 achieve the handwritten mathematical expression recognition with graph neural network.

Their project is of great content.

Each member prepared 2 aplication. They applied graph neural network in many area which shown the great potential of Graph neural network.

The analysis of experiment is well organized including result table, results comparison, and pros&cons.



Control Time.

## Group 3 Music Generation

Gan application.

Since the feeling of music is subjective evaluation by people, it is difficult to measure this music generation model.

Providing a standard procedure to evaluate music quality is much better.

Based on the music played from slides, adding more annotated labels for dataset is shall make the model create better sounding music.

Control Time



## Group 9 

As we are group 9, we can not evaluate ourselves' project.

If there is no time limitation, we could talk more about experiment result  analysis.
