Paper: Representation Learning withContrastive Predictive Coding

In this paper, the author present constractive predictive coding framework t oextracting compact latent representation to encoder prediction over future observations.

This presentation contains background, problem, methodology, and experiment part.

The methodology part needs contain more detail when talking about the loss function.

paper: Learning Placeholders for Open-Set Recognition

The difference between open-set recognition and genereal recognition, open-set able to recognition the object belong to the range of the training and learn to reject the wrong prediction.

Providing more content in evaluation shall be better like how would you like to improve the recognition.

In backgroup part, trying to provide more detail about other related work.
